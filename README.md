ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SerahNderitu, a dedicated web developer with a passion for coding ideas into web reality.
Armed with an innate curiosity and an eye for design, I ventured into the world of web development years ago and I've been hooked ever since. From mastering HTML and CSS to harnessing the dynamic power of JavaScript and Python,  I've developed my skills to build responsive, user-friendly websites that leave a lasting impression.

Iâ€™m a firm believer that a beautiful website is not just about lines of code, but the aesthetics and functionality. A website should not only look stunning but also enhance the user's experience, creating a harmonious balance between form and function. 

Beyond the Codeâ€¦
When Iâ€™m not writing lines of code, you'll likely find me taking nature walks, diving into a captivating motivational book, or undertaking meditation to maintain mental clarity. I firmly believe that a well-rounded life fuels creativity and keeps those problem-solving skills sharp.
